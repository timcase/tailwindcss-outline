# Tailwind CSS Outline

[![license](https://badgen.net/github/license/timcase/tailwindcss-outline)](https://github.com/timcase/tailwindcss-outline/blob/master/LICENSE)

##
NOTE: There is a published npm package that offers this same functionality:
[tailwind-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-outline)

This repo does the same thing but slightly differently. I recommend using
the published npm package listed above.

## Installation

```bash
npm install timcase/tailwindcss-outline
```

or using if you are using `yarn`

```bash
yarn add timcase/tailwindcss-outline
```

Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your Tailwind CSS configuration.

```js
plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-outline')()
]
```
